## Saying thanks ☕️

I design in the open as much as I can and encourage others to do the same. A credit to [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/charles_rt) and link back to this Github repo are greatly appreciated.

A few people have asked if they can buy me a coffee. Yes, if I ever see you in person a Soy Cappuccino would be amazing. If I never see you and you want to do the same, you can [buy me the digital equivalent to say thanks](https://monzo.me/charlesreynoldstalbot/3?d=Buy%20me%20a%20coffee%20%E2%98%95%EF%B8%8F).
